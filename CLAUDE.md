# CLAUDE.md — Pushlog App

AI assistant context for the `pushlog-app` repository. Read this before making changes.

---

## Project Overview

**Pushlog** is a client-side PWA for strength training. It tracks a rotating 4-workout program (Upper A/B, Lower A/B) across two day-sets, persisting all data in `localStorage`. There is no backend — the entire app is static HTML/CSS/JS.

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | React 19 + Vite 8 |
| Language | TypeScript 5 (strict mode) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3 (utility-first, no separate stylesheets) |
| Routing | React Router 7 (client-side only) |
| State | Context API + `useReducer` |
| Persistence | `localStorage` (keys: `pushlog:programs`, `pushlog:sessions`) |
| PWA | `vite-plugin-pwa` with Workbox auto-update |
| Drag & Drop | `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/sortable` |
| Icons | `lucide-react` |
| Animations | `canvas-confetti` + custom Tailwind keyframes |

## Data Model

All types live in `src/lib/types.ts`. Do not duplicate type definitions elsewhere.

```typescript
type WorkoutType = "upperA" | "upperB" | "lowerA" | "lowerB";
type DaySet = "day1" | "day2";

interface ExerciseTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  sets: number;
  minReps: number;
  maxReps: number;
  startingWeight?: number;
}

interface ProgramBlock {
  id: string;
  startedAt: string;       // ISO date string
  workouts: {
    day1: Record<WorkoutType, ExerciseTemplate[]>;
    day2: Record<WorkoutType, ExerciseTemplate[]>;
  };
}

interface LoggedExercise {
  templateId: string;
  name: string;
  setsCompleted: number;
  targetSets: number;
  minReps: number;
  maxReps: number;
  startingWeight?: number;
}

interface WorkoutSession {
  id: string;
  date: string;            // ISO date string
  workoutType: WorkoutType;
  daySet: DaySet;
  programBlockId: string;
  exercises: LoggedExercise[];
}
```

**localStorage keys:**
- `pushlog:programs` — `ProgramBlock[]`
- `pushlog:sessions` — `WorkoutSession[]`

---

## State Management

State lives in `src/context/AppContext.tsx`. Use the `useApp()` hook to access `state` and `dispatch`.

**Reducer actions:**

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `START_WORKOUT` | Begins a new session |
| `LOG_EXERCISE` | Updates exercise in active session |
| `SWAP_EXERCISE` | Replaces an exercise mid-workout (one-off, non-persisted) |
| `FINISH_WORKOUT` | Saves session to history |
| `SAVE_PROGRAM` | Persists a program block |
| `DELETE_PROGRAM` | Removes a program block |
| `UPDATE_WEIGHT` | Updates weight in active session and template |
| `ADD_EXERCISE` | Adds exercise to active workout (non-persisted, `id: "impromptu-${uuid}"`) |
| `REORDER_EXERCISES` | Reorders exercises in active session |
| `IMPORT_STATE` | Replaces all programs and sessions (used by Settings import) |

State changes trigger `useEffect` to sync to `localStorage`.

---

## Workout Rotation Logic

Sequence (from `src/lib/rotation.ts`):

```
upperA → lowerA → upperB → lowerB → (repeat)
```

- **DaySet** alternates every 8 completed workouts (2 full cycles).
- After 8 workouts, the UI prompts the user to start a new `ProgramBlock`.
- "Start New Block" copies the current program structure as the new baseline.

---

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev       # Vite dev server with --host (hot reload)
npm run build     # tsc -b && vite build (output: /dist)
npm run lint      # ESLint on entire project
npm run preview   # Preview production build locally
```

**Node version:** 22 (see `flake.nix`). If using Nix + direnv, run `direnv allow` to auto-load the environment.

No test framework is configured. Do not add tests without discussing the approach first.

## Code Conventions

### Naming
- `camelCase` — variables, functions, hooks
- `PascalCase` — React components, TypeScript interfaces/types
- `UPPER_CASE` — module-level constants (e.g., `PROGRAMS_KEY`, `SEQUENCE`, `TYPES`)
- File names match the component/hook they export (e.g., `ExerciseCard.tsx`)

### React Patterns
- **Functional components only** — no class components
- **Controlled inputs** — always use `value` + `onChange`
- **Custom hooks** for shared domain logic; pages handle complex orchestration
- **Context + useReducer** for global state — do not introduce external state libraries (Redux, Zustand, etc.) without explicit approval
- **No prop drilling past 2 levels** — lift to context if needed

### Styling
- **Tailwind utility classes only** — do not write custom CSS unless adding keyframe animations to `index.css`
- Keep component class lists readable; extract repeated patterns to variables if repeated 3+ times

### TypeScript
- **Strict mode is enabled** — no `any`, no `@ts-ignore` without justification
- All new types go in `src/lib/types.ts` unless they are purely component-local
- Use union types and discriminated unions for reducer actions (see `AppContext.tsx`)

### Immutability
- State updates always use spread operators or `Array.prototype` methods that return new arrays
- Never mutate state objects directly

### Drag & Drop
- Use `PointerSensor` for mouse, `TouchSensor` with `{ delay: 200, tolerance: 5 }` for touch
- Both `Today.tsx` and `ProgramEditor.tsx` use `@dnd-kit` — keep patterns consistent between them

## Key Behaviors to Preserve

1. **Exercise swap is one-off** — swapping mid-workout does not affect the saved program template.
2. **"Last time" reference** matches by `templateId` first, then by `name` (to handle swapped exercises).
3. **Weight update propagates** — changing weight during an active session also updates the exercise template for future sessions.
4. **Impromptu exercises** added mid-workout have `id: "impromptu-${uuid}"` and are not persisted to the program.
5. **Confetti fires** on `FINISH_WORKOUT` using `canvas-confetti` (violet/purple/white/teal palette).
6. **No rest day logging** — the app never prompts or records rest days.
7. **PWA installability** — do not break the service worker or manifest configuration.

---

## Architecture Constraints

- **No backend, no network calls** — all data is local. Do not introduce API calls, fetch, or axios.
- **No auth** — single-user app, no login flow.
- **No external CSS frameworks** beyond Tailwind — no Bootstrap, Material UI, etc.
- **Avoid heavy dependencies** — the app intentionally has a small bundle. Justify any new `dependencies` addition.

## Docs

- `docs/product.md` — Product spec; review before changing UX or adding features.
- `docs/architecture.md` — Technical decisions and rationale; update when making significant architecture changes.
- `docs/my-program.json` — Sample data for testing imports.

---

## Branch & Commit Guidelines

- Develop on feature branches; current active branch pattern: `claude/<description>-<id>`
- Commit messages are imperative, lowercase: `"add drag-to-reorder to program editor"`
- Keep commits focused — one logical change per commit
